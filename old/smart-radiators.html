    <p>These are some work-in-progress, mainly for my own benefit...</p>
    <h1>The problem</h1>
    <p>
    My partner and I both work from home. We live in a fairly leaky Victorian house.  In the winter we want to heat in various rooms at various times.</p>
    <p>
    Our thermostat allows us to turn everything on and off to the same
    schedule, based on the temperature in a single room.
    </p>

    <p>One solution is to go round turning all the radiator valves on and off each day, but we never do that. It seems very likely we're wasting a lot of money on heating the entire house most days in the winter.</p>
    <h1>The solution</h1>
    <p>There are various more expensive solutions with nicer-looking valves, but it seems that the <a href="https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/overview/0812043/MAX-Wireless-Heating-Control">EQ Max system</a> is good value and fairly reliable.  The <a href="https://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/product/1378424/MAX-Wireless-thermostat-head-Basic?ref=list">TRVs</a> communicate with 868MHz RF to a "Cube" device. This device supports grouping TRVs into rooms, setting programs (e.g. *21 degrees centigrade between 0900 and 1300*), and various functions like checking battery life.  The cube is controlled via Java software which runs as a web server on your computer. It is packaged for Windows and Mac but a community member has helpfully <a href="https://github.com/shawn-ogg/maxapp_linux_installer">repackaged it</a> for Linux. The protocol <a href="https://github.com/Bouni/max-cube-protocol">has been reverse engineered</a>, of which there are various implementations around the web.</p>
    <p>By all accounts the cube is a little buggy and forgets its associations between the TRV devices and the named programs.  Instead of using the cube, you can consider using the open source `culfw` software, and either (a) flashing the cube (<a href="https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,38404.0.html?PHPSESSID=g9gjrbkpt56p5qnv1on6nnlr16">German instructions</a>) or (b) using your own CUL module and <a href="https://forum.pimatic.org/topic/2483/pimatic-maxcul-and-max-cube-with-aculfw-acting-as-cul/45">flashing that</a>.</p>
    <p>If you keep the EQ-Max software, you can stop there. I'm planning on using OpenHAB which has a MAX Cube plugin, so I can control it remotely, in particular via an old smart phone that can be fixed in the living room.  Also OpenHAB rules will allow greater flexibility (<a href="https://community.openhab.org/t/heating-boilerplate-a-universal-temperature-control-solution-with-modes/34843/13">example</a>).  The only other bit missing from this system is boiler control.  Without an integrated switch, you will still end up heating things unecessarily: your system should include a radiator without a TRV to guarantee there is flow for the boiler, and this is still liable to be running all day. My plan is to use a Raspberry PI to run OpenHAB, and fit a relay to that and fit it where our current thermostat lives.  That will allow me to calculate when none of the MAX valves are demanding heat, and turn the boiler off completely at that point (<a href="https://community.openhab.org/t/max-heating-system-boiler-controller-and-window-contacts/34195/6">example rules 1</a>, <a href="">2</a>).</p>
    <h2>Fitting the valves</h2>
    <p>The valves use M30 x 1.5mm standard thread size which fits most modern radiators, and are supplied with a Danfoss RA adaptor which is rarely used in the UK.  If you're lucky, you can just unscrew the union nut by hand (or with a bit of help from a plumber's wrench) and attach the EQ-MAX TRV with its own union nut.</p>
    <p>Older radiators are more of a pain. Two of the radiators in my house are <i>Comap Westherm</i> which uses M28 x 1mm.  You'll have to hope you can find an adaptor (<a href="https://www.heatingcontrolsonline.co.uk/28mm-trv-adaptors-p-386.html">I could</a>), or you'll need to get a plumber to change the radiator fittings for you. <a href="https://energenie4u.co.uk/res/pdfs/Valve%20Adaptor%20List%20V5.pdf">Here's a handy list of adapter sizes</a>. </p>
    <p>Sometimes you'll see an `F2` error message on the adaptor after fitting. This means it's not seated properly. I gave older valves a squirt with some lubricant and jiggled the little stud that opens and closes the valve with some soft hammer taps.  Where there's a long thread you have to tighten the nut a bit further than you expect to get a snug internal fit against the stud.  On the radiators wheren I used adaptors, the problem was the pin in the adaptor was not snug against the inner pin (on the radiator), so I placed a 1p coin inside the adaptor, and this seemed to work</p>
      <h2>Random observations</h2>
      <p>When playing with scripting, I found TRVs would randomly stop responding. It turns out this is because of the "1% rule" - each RF band has a "duty cycle" which is the maximum ratio of time on the air per hour. Basically, 1% means you can speak 36s per hour.</p>
